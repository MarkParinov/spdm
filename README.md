What you just read was a quick guide to my project - spdm, which you can also view with ```spdm``` or ```spdm help``` after you install it. I tried to make it as readable as possbile, so others can modify it. That was the practical part of the README, now I'll say a bit about the app as a person:

I like this project, maybe I'll even code my own package db at some point. I'm just having fun, don't judge the code strictly, although, I'll be more than happy to receive a couple of stars on this repo, just so I know that people like it. Feel free to report any bugs that you run into while using the app, you can always write me a line **markthesecond222@gmail.com**,
and I'll make sure to reply! Anyway, thanks for your time, happy coding :)
